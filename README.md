For the weather i used the openweathermap API to get the data of the current day of the specified city in .json format and dynamiccally create a html div to display it.
Also I used a small function to retireve the hour and based on it the greetings are changed dynamically.

In the index html , it basically is an introduction to myself and a set of images which shows like a slideshow and it is done by using the js function loadArticles() where it will only show the image with 'active' as class.
After that, there are some articles on AI and robotics which are displayed using th API from dev.to.

In the contact html, i have added a google maps embed link so that the location can be seen easily.

In the profile html i have made a simple layout which shows about my technical skills, education qualifications and so on.

In the weather web html, it shows the weather of Kochi as default but it can also take in a city name and show the details of weather about it .

In the projects html, it shows some of my small projects which I have been working for some time.


In this website, the main i tried to focus on is to make it responsive and consistent. In the future i will be updating the website.
